I developed it with claude.ai.

Here's an overview of the key technologies used in the Love Match app.

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React framework used for routing, server-side rendering.
* [React](https://react.dev) JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) CSS framework, used for styling and responsive design.
* [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) Components Tailwind CSS used for buttons.
* [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) Icon library for heart and share icons.
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) Typescript
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs) For Deployment.

The app does client-side state management with React hooks, floating heart animations with CSS, has a responsive design with Tailwind, and
share functionality using Web Share API. Uses an algorithm similar to [djb2](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html) hashing for name matching.
