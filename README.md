# Love Match

Play It

I developed it with claude.ai.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Here's an overview of the key technologies used in the Love Match app.

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React framework for production, Used for routing, server-side rendering.
* [React](https://react.dev) JavaScript library for building user interfaces, Used for component-based development.
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) Utility-first CSS framework, Used for styling and responsive design.
* [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) Re-usable components built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI, Used for UI components like buttons, cards.
* [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) Icon library, Used for heart icons and share icons.
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) JavaScript with syntax for types, Used for type safety and better development experience.
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs) Deployment and hosting platform, Used for hosting the application.

The app does client-side state management with React hooks, floating heart animations with CSS, has a responsive design with Tailwind, and
share functionality using Web Share API. Uses an algorithm similar to [djb2](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html) hashing for name matching.
